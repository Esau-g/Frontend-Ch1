## My process

I started my process by adding htlm tags and specificity and then I linked the css file and started working to take my code to look the same as the challenge.
I managed to do it pretty well but I struggle to put everything in the center and I asked AI to help view what I was doing wrong, I was adding a fixed width instead of a max width and then it helped me with the media quearies which I was having trubbles with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned not to add a fixed width in orther to make it more responsive and I understood better how flex works and how media queries work.

```css
.card {
    margin: auto;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 320px;
    height: 500px;
    margin-top: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 40px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 0px 10px 45px 0.1px #c6ccd6;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on flex and maybe add grid to it and how to add media queries. Also learn how to write more responsive code.

### Useful resources

- (https://claude.ai/new) - This helped me to understand why my queries weren't working. I had fixed with on the body and other classes.
